 * Question 3 -- Complete the method mode
 */
public class Q3 {

    /**
     * This method determines the mode of a given list of int values. Mode of a
     * list is the most commonly occurring element. In other words, the element
     * with the highest frequency. For example, in the list
     * {1,2,3,3,3,5,6,6,10}, the mode is 3. Assume that the list is sorted and
     * has a unique mode. The list will have a least one element.
     *
     * Examples :
     * 		- In {-2,-2,-2,3,3,4,4,5,8,9,9} the mode is -2
     * 		- In {5} the mode is 5
     * 		- In {13,15,17,17,19} the mode is 17
     *
     * @param list
     *            is a sorted 1-dimensional array (list).
     * @return mode of the given list.
