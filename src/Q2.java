     * unique.

     * @return
     * 		true if both s1 and s2 contain the same characters
     * 		false for all other cases
     *
     * Examples:
     * 		return true if s1 = "Riya" and s2 = "Rayi"
     * 		return true if s1 = "" and s2 = ""
     * 		return true if s1 = "123" and s2 = "312"
     *
     * 		return false if s1 = "Riya" and s2 = "riya"
     * 		return false if either s1 or s2 is null
     * 		return false if s1 = "Nash" and s2 = "Don"
